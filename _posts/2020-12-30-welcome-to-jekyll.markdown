Hi and welcome to my blog - I work as an embedded software developer for __Automated Manual Transmissions__ and love driving big machines.  
On the side, I also have a huge passion for training and moveemnts - fitnees has been one of the constants in my life. Whatever strugles and emotions that I traverse, movement is what always help me move through them.    In this blog I will be discussing and sharing ideas on random topics.
